					<h1>Challenge</h1>
					<p>In January of 2019, Sweden became a regulated gambling market under the Swedish Gambling Authority (Spelinspektionen), putting several responsible gambling laws in place. One of these requires all players to set deposit limits, which happens either on log-in or registration.</p>
					<p>This law is great as it forces the player to think about their gambling habits and hopefully leads to greater player protection, but a few months after our initial release, it became clear that players were setting incorrect limits, leading to lots of player frustration, customer support contacts, and loss of revenue.</p>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col">
					<p>The problem came to us from our business organisation, and they had already done a lot of research into BI-data and the number of complaints relating to the actual setting of limits. The conclusion was that the current flow of setting limits needed improvement, as well as lowering the threshold for the user making a decision.</p>
					<p>We saw a pattern where players were either setting their limits too low, or astronomically high in order to never be reached, and we wanted to get a better spread based on our different player segments as neither scenario was helping the player stay safe. </p>
					<p>Our initial implementation was under a tight deadline, and had copied the controls and flows used on the site for a long time. We knew this implementation had usability issues to begin with and as such I saw this as a great opportunity to return and make improvements with a fresh look at how we want limits to work.</p>
					<p>We developed the assumption that we could help the players set better limits with anchoring, as well as decreasing time to complete with the help of automated suggestions. </p>
					<p>I also dug into our Voice of Customer reports and interviewed staff in Customer Service and found that to a large extent, limits were also being set incorrectly because of a lack of understanding of what they’re meant to do and how they work.</p>
					<p>From there I started prototyping.</p>

					<h1>Improving the limits flow</h1>
					<p>As mentioned, the initial implementation lacked any kind of anchoring, and the controls were quite unintuitive. So to help players get a better idea of what a “ballpark” for their limits might be, we asked our country managers to help us develop a list of suggested amounts based on our different player segments, and being mindful of <a href="https://lawsofux.com/millers-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="Miller's law">Miller's Law</a>, we kept the list to six options, plus an option for “Other amount” in case none of the suggestions were a good fit.</p>
					<p>After throwing some ideas down on paper, I settled on a simple dropdown with a separator between the suggestions and “Other amount”, and did some Hallway Usability Testing to verify both the order of items, and that people understood it as a separate option.</p>
					<p>In order to decrease time to complete and mental strain on the users part, we added automated calculations based on what the player set as their daily limit, and to help with attention and understanding, I added some simple animations to the controls as they were being added to the page.</p>
					<p>Testing and iterating on this flow showed that users were in fact completing it much faster, but only once they understood how the limits worked. I had used our standard little info box as my sole source of explanation of limit mechanics, and it was clear that it was not sufficient.</p>

			<h1>Increasing player understanding</h1>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-12 col">
					<p>As my research had shown, players had trouble understanding how limits work, and to be honest, it’s sometimes difficult for us to even explain it.</p>
					<p>I tried a number of in-page options, but the information was too dense, and I found that people skipped over reading it anyhow. I then struck upon the idea of going the opposite direction and instead giving the information center stage as its own little ‘feature’, and sketched out ‘The Intermission’ as it became known.</p>
					<div class="user-journey">
						<div class="user-journey__point user-journey__point--previous">Log in / Registration</div>
						<div class="user-journey__point user-journey__point--current">Limit setting</div>
						<div class="user-journey__point">Deposit</div>
						<div class="user-journey__point">Play</div>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center text-small mb-5">User journey</p>
					<p>At this point the user is most likely coming directly from having registered, and we now need to have them go through more input controls. I figured we could ‘reset’ them a little from input fatigue, by letting the information break off visually and take over the entire screen, which met with approval from the entire team and I then let that concept grow.</p>

					<h2>Onboarding animation</h2>
					<p>I designed my screens in Sketch, and then brought everything into Invision Studio to be animated.</p>
					<p>Coming from a background in front-end development, I tried to stay mindful of the fact that whatever I came up with here would need to be translated into code <i>at production speed</i>, which meant that in order for the concept to be accepted, I also needed to show that we would not be taking on an unrealistic workload every time we had to produce a new limit animation.</p>
					<p>I tried my best to give the animations a calm tempo, and made sure they made sense at a glance at their end state, in case the user was busy scanning the text.</p>
					<p>I tested the animation flow as well, testing for information retention and subjective experience. Once I felt confident with what I had, I presented the entire prototype from onboarding to completed limit flow for our stakeholders with great reception, and we managed to get the story points needed to move into production.</p>

			<h2>Handover</h2>
			<p>The best developer hand-over for animation is almost always in code, rather than a video produced in Studio or After Effects. Instead of having to document easings and timings, it's right there on the page for them. So I brought up a new Pen and produced the animation to be easily adapted to whatever triggers our code stack might provide.</p>

					<h1>Usability testing</h1>
					<p>Before releasing to market we brought in players for usability testing on the entire flow using our eyetracker from <a href="https://www.tobiipro.com/sprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" alt="Tobii Sprint">Tobii</a>, which generated a completion rate of 100% and a 45% decrease in Time to Complete (time spent on onboarding discounted).</p>
					<p>This gave us enough confidence to release, and after a hardening phase we went to market!</p>

					<h1>Impact after release</h1>
					<p class="mb-5">Data for this case was collected about three months after release and should be measured further, but shows that we had a significant impact on the KPI's we were targeting.</p>

					<h3>Limit setting</h3>
					<p>One of the initial problems we had was that limits were being set either too low, or too high. With the new flow, we achieved a much more nuanced spread, where we are now seeing a wider variety within the segments, but also that the segments themselves are now fairly evenly split between low, middle, and high limits.</p>
					<p>With limits now being easier to understand and set correctly, we saw our deposits go up by about <strong>15%</strong> (trending steadily), which is the highest we've had in Sweden since the new regulation.</p>
					<p>After the introduction of the new flow, conversion in registration has also increased by about <strong>10%</strong>. Conversion was not initially a metric we were considering, but as no other changes were implemented in the registration flow, the conclusion is that the old deposit limit implementation caused a bigger drop-off point than we anticipated.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
					<h3>Player understanding</h3>
					<p>The new onboarding was A/B tested, where half our registering players were shown the onboarding and the other half wasn't in order to determine its impact.</p>
					<p>The group without onboarding showed a slight decrease in numbers, but for the onboarded segment we've lowered the number of customer support issues relating to limits by <strong>40%</strong>.</p>
					<p>Additionally, the propensity for contacts relating to them (number of contacts in relation to number of active players) has gone down by over <strong>50%</strong>!</p>

					<h2>Limit setting</h2>
					<p>For the flow, I had the idea of a custom control where the user could input their own value in the same dialog as the pre-defined choices, which would eliminate the step of have two different flows entirely.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
					<h2>Player understanding</h2>
					<p>I think we could clarify the different limit segments we've calculated to give the user a better idea of which one they feel they might fit into. As we suggest values, there's some anchoring to consider, but we could explain further how it would calculate to their actual playing spending.</p>
					<p>I would like to more clearly track each segment that chose from the pre-defined list to see how their choice relates to their actual behavior, so we can make sure there's not a mismatch in expectations there. Further CS contact improvements might be made from that!</p>
